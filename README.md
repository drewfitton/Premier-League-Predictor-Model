## Overview
The Premier League Predictor Model is a pipeline that performs the following:

* Data Scraping: Scrapes match statistics and odds across 20 premier league seasons
* Feature Creation: Creates meaningful features to train an ML model to predict future matches
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze our data based upon our features to see correlations from each feature to team results
* Machine Learning Model: Develop 4 machine learning models and analyze accuracy to determine the best model for our application

## Requirements

The first requirement to run this application is to have react installed via Pip on your system. The app also requires that you have a flask connection to an ML model for match prediction. See my github repository "Premier League Predictor Model" to find the backend pipeline that this app runs with.

To run the project with react:

npm start

This will start the application on the local server http://localhost:3000.

Enjoy the app and hopefully it provides some good predictions for you!
